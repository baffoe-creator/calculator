# Simple React Calculator

This project is a basic calculator application built using React. It supports fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes functionalities for clearing the display, handling negative numbers, and inputting decimals.

**Key Features:**

* Clear display for input and results.
* Buttons for digits (0-9) and decimal point.
* Arithmetic operation buttons (+, -, Ã—, /).
* Clear all (AC) functionality.
* Handling of negative numbers.
* Equals (=) button to compute the result.

The `Calculator.js` file contains the React functional component `Calculator` which manages the calculator's state and logic using React hooks (`useState`). It handles user input, performs calculations, and updates the display accordingly. The component is rendered into the `root` element of the HTML.
